## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="archit.jpg">

Hi! I am Archit, a senior at Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur currently completing a BS+MS major in Mathematics and Computing with minor in Computer Science and Engineering. I've had stints with competitive programming and software development.  Currently, I'm a perception team member at Aerial Robotics Lab, Kharagpur and also interested in Reinforcement Learning. 

Hit me up if you've got a cool idea regarding any of those and wish to collaborate!

## Present

* Working on a cool web service. More coming soon!

* Developing methods to train and infer from extremely deep and sparse neural networks while preserving performance. 

* Life?

* Preparing for a possible spot at the ICPC-WF 2021.

* You can find me on codeforces as [architrungta120](https://codeforces.com/profile/architrungta120).

## Past

* Part of the only sophomore team from IIT Kharagpur to qualify for ICPC regionals in India. We were ranked 42nd in the Amritapuri Regionals and came in at 4th rank from our university.

* Won 1st prize at indoor IMAV 2019, a micro aerial vehicle competition. I was involved in the finite state machine and computer vision modules. Had to write a new module that used temporary log files while our contest time was running (<5 minutes left) as the old one failed due to a race condition.

* Made a glove with Shreyansh Darshan that uses IMU sensor to map the entire hand with all its motions. As a sample use, created neural networks to learn sign language symbols and interpret. The project was coded in C++ and Python.  [Video demonstration](https://youtu.be/Rl1C584UrW0).

* Had a run with PoW cryptocurrency miners. Wrote the first [GPU miner for Keccak PoW](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=453573.0). Collaborated with [Dr. Dave Anderson](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dga/) from CMU to port his Linux CUDA miner for Momentum to Windows. Also wrote one of the first two Monero mining pools. 

* Wrote a 3D perspetive projector from scratch using C++ and Windows API as highschool senior year CS project. 

* Developed some of the most popular mods for Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 3 back in 8th grade. Including [External RCON](https://www.itsmods.com/forum/Thread-Release-BigBrotherBot-External-Rcon-0-5-Chat-viewer-0-2-beta.html) and [MapEdit](https://www.itsmods.com/forum/Thread-Release-MapEdit-for-MW3-1-4.html).

* Attended the Indian Informatics Olympiad Training Camp in 2017 and 2018. First participant from my state ever and the youngest one at 'TC 2017. 

## Future

* ICPC WF? 

* Graduate?

* More research?

* ...

## Random

* Whiteboards help me think better. The bigger, the better. 

* I love going out for trips and exploring different cultures/environments!

* Indian Food > All other cuisines. Please change my mind. 

* airbnb > hotels. Can't change my mind.

* Anime > everything else. 

* Coldplay is <3 

## Publications

Hopefully coming soon!
