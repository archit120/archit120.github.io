## Some technical and random musings

2. [GSoC Blog 1 - The Beginning](blog/gsoc1) First in hopefully a series of posts about how I came up with the idea, wrote the proposal and what the work was like. This post in particular is about how I got started. 

1. [K-Balanced Teams](blog/k-bal) A very interesting DP problem that I found on codeforces. Might be easy for DP pros but eh. I also talk about the basics of dynamic programming and the general idea.

Shoot me an email, if you got anything to add/discuss!
