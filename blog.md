## Some technical and random musings

4. [GSoC Final Evaluation Post](/blog/gsocfinal) The final blog post for my GSoC Project

2. [GSoC Blog 1 - The Beginning](/blog/gsoc1) First in hopefully a series of posts about how I came up with the idea, wrote the proposal and what the work was like. This post in particular is about how I got started. 

1. [A Fresh Start](/blog/intro) A technical blog stars with a random, well sorta, muse about what it aims to be.
